# Lab 1: Getting Prepared for Digital Forensic Programming

## Purpose

This lab will help you prepare your environment for digital forensic programming using Python. By the end of this session, you should be able to:

* Use **VS Code** with the integrated terminal.
* Create and activate a **Python virtual environment**.
* Install and verify required packages inside the virtual environment.
* Confirm that **Git** is installed and available.
* Run a simple forensic Python program.

---

## Section A ‚Äì University Lab Machines (No Admin Rights)

### Important Notes

* You **do not have administrator rights** on lab machines.
* All packages must be installed inside the **virtual environment**.
* Do **not** try to install globally ‚Äî it will fail.
* IT staff have provided a pre-compiled wheel file (`pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`) so you don‚Äôt need to compile from source.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äì Check Environment in VS Code Terminal

If python is not recognized or shows the wrong version on Windows lab machines, run these PowerShell commands in the VS Code terminal (no admin needed), then proceed with the checks below.

1) Use the installed Python immediately in this terminal:
```powershell
Set-Alias -Name python -Value "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe"; Set-Alias -Name python3 -Value "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe"; python --version
```

2) Make it take precedence in this terminal:
```powershell
$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Python313;C:\Program Files\Python313\Scripts;" + $env:Path; Get-Command python; python --version
```

3) Make it permanent for your user (restart VS Code after running):
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', "C:\Program Files\Python313;C:\Program Files\Python313\Scripts;" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User'), 'User')
```

4) Open App execution aliases and toggle off ‚ÄúApp Installer python.exe‚Äù and ‚Äúpython3.exe‚Äù:
```powershell
Start-Process "ms-settings:apps-advanced-app-settings"
```

   ```bash
   python --version
   pip --version
   git --version
   ```

   * `python` and `pip` must respond with a version.
   * `git` should also respond with a version (if not, Git is not available on this lab machine).

   If pip is missing or broken on Windows lab machines, run these in the VS Code PowerShell terminal:

   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" -m pip --version
   
   # If pip is missing, install/repair it and upgrade pip
   & "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" -m ensurepip --upgrade; & "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" -m pip install --upgrade pip
   
   # Then use the PATH steps above to prioritize Python 3.13 in this terminal and make it permanent if needed.

   $env:Path = "C:\Program Files\Python313\;C:\Program Files\Python313\Scripts\;$env:Path"; [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path',"C:\Program Files\Python313\;C:\Program Files\Python313\Scripts\;" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User'),'User')
   ```

### Step 2 ‚Äì Create a Virtual Environment

1. In VS Code, open the folder where you will store your lab work.

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   *(On macOS, use `python3` instead of `python` if needed.)*

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   * **Windows (PowerShell inside VS Code)**:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```
     If you encounter an execution policy error, run the following command to temporarily bypass it, then try activating again:
   ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
   ```  ```

   * **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` at the start.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì Test Pip Functionality

Before installing the complex `pytsk3` package, let's verify that pip works correctly in your virtual environment.

1. Install a simple test package:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

   You should see `requests` and its dependencies listed.

3. Test that the package works:

   ```bash
   python -c "import requests; print('Pip and virtual environment working correctly!')"
   ```

   If this prints the success message, your pip and virtual environment are functioning properly.

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì Install Packages from Local Wheel File

Since lab machines cannot compile packages, use the wheel provided by IT staff.

1. Ensure the wheel file (`pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`) is copied into your lab folder.

2. With the virtual environment activated, install using:

   ```bash
   pip install pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
   ```

   Or, if the file is in another directory, use the full path:

   ```bash
   pip install "C:\path\to\pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl"
   ```

3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

   You should see `pytsk3` listed.

---

### Step 5 ‚Äì Verify Pytsk3 Installation

Create a simple test script to verify that `pytsk3` is working correctly.

1. Create a file called `test_pytsk3.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   """
   Simple test script to verify pytsk3 installation and basic functionality.
   """
   
   import re
   import sys
   
   def test_pytsk3_import():
       """Test if pytsk3 can be imported successfully."""
       try:
           import pytsk3
           print("‚úì pytsk3 imported successfully")
           print(f"  Version: {pytsk3.TSK_VERSION_STR}")
           return True
       except ImportError as e:
           print(f"‚úó Failed to import pytsk3: {e}")
           return False
   
   def test_regex_functionality():
       """Test basic regex functionality for forensic pattern matching."""
       try:
           # Test email pattern matching (common in forensics)
           email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
           test_text = "Found emails: john.doe@example.com and admin@forensics.lab"
           
           emails = re.findall(email_pattern, test_text)
           
           if len(emails) == 2:
               print("‚úì Regex functionality working correctly")
               print(f"  Found emails: {emails}")
               return True
           else:
               print(f"‚úó Regex test failed - expected 2 emails, found {len(emails)}")
               return False
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"‚úó Regex test failed: {e}")
           return False
   
   def main():
       """Run all tests."""
       print("Testing Digital Forensics Environment Setup...")
       print("=" * 50)
       
       pytsk3_ok = test_pytsk3_import()
       regex_ok = test_regex_functionality()
       
       print("=" * 50)
       
       if pytsk3_ok and regex_ok:
           print("üéâ All tests passed! Your environment is ready for digital forensics work.")
           return 0
       else:
           print("‚ùå Some tests failed. Please check your installation.")
           return 1
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       sys.exit(main())
   ```

2. Run the test script:

   ```bash
   python test_pytsk3.py
   ```

   You should see output indicating that both pytsk3 and regex functionality are working correctly.

## Section B ‚Äì Personal Laptops (With Admin Rights)

### Step 1 ‚Äì Install Required Software

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

   * Download from: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
   * Install the **Python extension**.

2. **Python 3.11 (Recommended)**

   * The provided wheel file (`pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`) is compiled for Python 3.11 (`cp311`).  
   * Download Python 3.11 from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * If you use a different Python version, the wheel file may not install correctly.

   * Download from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * Tick **Add Python to PATH** during installation.
   * Verify installation:

     ```bash
     python --version
     pip --version
     ```

3. **Git**

   * Download from: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   * Verify installation:

     ```bash
     git --version
     ```

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Create and Use a Virtual Environment

Even with admin rights, it is **best practice** to use a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate      # Windows  
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux  
```

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì Test Pip Functionality

Before installing the complex `pytsk3` package, verify that pip works correctly.

```bash
pip install requests
pip list
python -c "import requests; print('Pip and virtual environment working correctly!')"
```

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì Install Packages

You have **two options**:

**Option A (Recommended for Consistency ‚Äì Use Local Wheel File)**  
If you have been given the same wheel file (`pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`):

```bash
pip install pytsk3-20250312-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
```

*Why use the local wheel file?*  
Installing `pytsk3` directly from PyPI often fails on Windows because it requires a C++ compiler (such as Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools) to build the package from source. Most users do not have these build tools installed, and the build process can be complex. The pre-built wheel file avoids this problem by providing a ready-to-install package.

**Option B (Install from PyPI ‚Äì Requires Compiler and Internet)**

```bash
pip install pytsk3
```

*Note:* If you try this option and see an error like  
`error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required`,  
it means you need to use the local wheel file instead.

Confirm installation with:

```bash
pip list
```

---

### Step 5 ‚Äì Verify Pytsk3 Installation

Create and run the same test script as described in Section A:

1. Create `test_pytsk3.py` (see Section A, Step 5 for the complete code).
2. Run the verification:

   ```bash
   python test_pytsk3.py
   ```

   You should see output indicating that both pytsk3 and regex functionality are working correctly.
